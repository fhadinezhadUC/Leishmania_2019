Visualizations: 
		       1: scores of ara-only genes vs aragorn scores in intersection (relatively low) 
		       2: Look at genes within clusters (clusters are genes within distance of 5k):
			  Clusters that include ara only genes are visualized. 
			  (Genes colored with blue are found by both ara and tse, genes colored red are found only by ara. 
			  We had 30 clusters of length more than 1 which include 82 out of 741 ara-only genes. 659 ara-only genes were single genes not close to other genes.)
			  Notes: 
			  a) most of the clusters visualized have repeated genes, So they might be in repeat regions (does it mean they are redundant and pseudo?!)
			    (use MUMMER to find all the repeat regions in these genomes! Use R GRanges to see how many of these genes are within repeat regions)
			  b) visualize clusters of length more than one or two in two genomes that have ara-only genes
			  c) 
		        3: Their secondary structure > table (average length of three loops, location/length of intron, average length of arms, insertions?) 


1. Pick a gene set including the high-confidence ara-only genes as an input for tsfm
2. Document: 
		1. TSE bugs
		2. if I see clusters similar between genomes
		3.
