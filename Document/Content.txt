List of content:
. Update the genomes from TryTryp website (script for downloading the current version)
. Run Aragorn and trnaScane-SE to find the genes (keep the script for running them)
. Explain the options used for running the genefinders.
. Explain the method used for integrating the genes, keeping all the information
  Compare tse vs. ara:
	. Compare the position displacement between Ara and tse
	. Compare the identity mismatch of ara and tse 
	. Analyse the reasons of displacement/ and identity mismatch
	. Sumerize and compare Union vs. Intersection vs. tse vs. ara tRNA genes
	. 
. A summery of gene set (including functional class coverage of each genome!)
. 
  
. improving 
. the pipeline used for filtering genes
. a summary of our genes after filtering
.  
1. why do we make function logos?
2. Why do we make ID logos?
3. why KLD?
