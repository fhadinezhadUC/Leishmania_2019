Tuesday: 

Leish:
	 0. Make a final gene set including some of the aragorn genes
	    a) Use score cutoff
            b) keep ara-only genes that are similar to gene models in intersection
	    b) keep pseudo genes with normal ss structure (summerize the SS of ara-only genes)
	 
	 After first round of finalizing the gene set:
	 1. Implement a method to find the distance of clusters:
	    a) Assign clusters to the genes
	    b) Create a new dataframe with columns: "sourceOrg","soureSeq","clusterID","clusterSeq", "clusterBegin","clusterEnd","clusterDir"
	    c) Keep clusters with more than 2 genes. 
	    ***
	    d) make a matrix to keep the parwise distance of clusters. group clusters. each group has a distance of max 1.
	       Report clusters of distance 0, 
	    e) Look for the cluster of genes with potential anticodon switching
	    f) implement an script:
	       for clusters that are in more than one genomes 
               look for the closest gene clusters around these clusters and see if they match 
	  2. find the repeat regions using MUMMER. 
	     find overlaps of cluster and repeat regions using R GRanges

TSFM:
 	 1. Decide about the final gene set and have explanations for the genes that you include
	    exclude: pseudo genes, genes with antocodon swithing,
