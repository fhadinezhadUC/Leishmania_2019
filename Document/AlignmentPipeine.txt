Add one section to the Document for the alignment method and validation. and integrate the whole pipeline into one script 
0. removed the intron, insertions, and variable arms ( Details:detecting introns,detecting insertions: detecting variable arms: ) and sequences with more than three loops
1. call covea to do the first alignment on the intersection of the genes. (should I remove noises before running covea? will it affect the alignment? Use the union for the alignment or intersection?) 
2. using covea's secondary structure, 
3. using the results, we removed the sites that had more than 99% gap. removed the sequences with more than 8 gaps. 
4. mapping the results to sprinzl using the final structure of sequences after filtering. How to do that. by eye?! 
5. validating the result. (use a sample set which had been aligned and filtered before and do the same thing on them and compare the results.)
6. integrate the codes for step 2, 3 and 4
7. How good is the alignment? does covea gives us a number?
8. what is the distribution of scores for tRNAscan-SE and Aragorn? normal?
9. what is the zscore of the sequences that have anticodon shifts? 

find the outliers in each model



1. in big clusters, what are the different models that we have? 
2. when making the profiles 
use p-value and z-score 

1. for each model find the outliers using OD-seq
   The disribution of number of outliers for each model from total
2. concatenate all the outlier sequences and remove them from the main fasta file. 
3. using the new fasta file make the profiles 
4. calculate the scores of all the sequences
5. visuaize the distribution of the scores of sequences in each model to see if they fallow normal distriution
6. saw that some of the distributions are bimodal which is because we need to cluster the genomes before making the model.


make two clusters, then make the models
look at the distribution, are they normal? continue clustering until it gets normal?
should I continue clustering untill the distribution gets normal? 
if now the distribution is normal:
assign clusters to the outlier sequences. 
find the score of each outlier sequence against all models of that cluster
calculate the z-score
find the one with highest z-score, is it same as the model assigned to the sequence? if not... maybe anticodon shift?

I should probably extract the outliers in each model for each cluster seperately??
