Add one section to the Document for the alignment method and validation. and integrate the whole pipeline into one script 
0. removed the intron, insertions, and variable arms ( Details:detecting introns,detecting insertions: detecting variable arms: ) and sequences with more than three loops
1. call covea to do the first alignment on the intersection of the genes. (should I remove noises before running covea? will it affect the alignment? Use the union for the alignment or intersection?) 
2. using covea's secondary structure, 
3. using the results, we removed the sites that had more than 99% gap. removed the sequences with more than 8 gaps. 
4. mapping the results to sprinzl using the final structure of sequences after filtering. How to do that. by eye?! 
5. validating the result. (use a sample set which had been aligned and filtered before and do the same thing on them and compare the results.)
6. integrate the codes for step 2, 3 and 4
7. How good is the alignment? does covea gives us a number?
8. what is the distribution of scores for tRNAscan-SE and Aragorn? normal?
9. what is the zscore of the sequences that have anticodon shifts? 

1. in big clusters, what are the different models that we have? 
2. when making the profiles 
use p-value and z-score
