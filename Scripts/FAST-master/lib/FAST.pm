=head1 NAME

FAST - FAST Analysis of Sequences Toolbox

=head1 VERSION

Version 1.07

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The Fast Analysis of Sequences Toolbox (FAST) is a set of UNIX
utilities (for example fasgrep, fascut, fashead and fastr) that
extends the UNIX toolbox paradigm to bioinformatic sequence
records. Modeled after the UNIX textutils (such as grep, cut, head,
tr, etc), FAST workflows are designed for "inline" (serial) processing
of flatfile biological sequence record databases per-sequence, rather
than per-line, through UNIX pipelines. The default data exchange
format is multifasta (specifically, a restriction of BioPerl FastA
format). FASTQ format is supported. FAST is designed for learnability,
interoperability, interface consistency, rapid prototyping, fine-tuned
control, and reproducibility. FAST tools expose the power of Perl and
BioPerl to users in an easy-to-learn command-line paradigm.
